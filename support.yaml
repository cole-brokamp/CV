description: The primary objective of this award is to compare the geocoding (assigning latitude and longitude coordinates to addresses) accuracy of our software DeGAUSS (DEcentralized Geomarker Assessment for mUlti Site Studies) to with other common geocoding software. Furthermore, each method will be evaluated based on it ability to correctly estimate environmental exposures and community-level characteristics.

title: Using Machine Learning to Supplement Electronic Health Record databases with Individual Socioeconomic Status
description: Retrospective epidemiological studies are often created using electronic health record databases.  Although these records are "wide", they are not "deep" with respect to individual level demographic data.  We propose a novel machine learning based approach that uses open city and auditor databases to predict individual level income and family socioeconomic status.  This will solve the urgent problem of unconfounding for individual SES in the execution of EHR based research.

title: Neurobehavioral and Neuroimaging Effects of Traffic Exposure in Children
description: The association between exposure to traffic-related air pollutants (TRAP) during early childhood and neurobehavioral and neuroimaging outcomes has not been thoroughly examined. The objective of the proposed study is to determine if children exposed to increased levels of TRAP during critical time periods of brain development have altered neurobehavior in childhood as measured by a battery of valid and reliable tests and to assess the physiologic impact of TRAP exposure on brain structure, organization, and function using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These results will fill important gaps in current scientific knowledge related to the relationship between TRAP exposure and neurobehavior and central nervous system effects.
