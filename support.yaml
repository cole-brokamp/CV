title: Validating a Geocoding Approach for Multi Site Studies
description: The primary objective of this award is to compare the geocoding (assigning latitude and longitude coordinates to addresses) accuracy of our software DeGAUSS (DEcentralized Geomarker Assessment for mUlti Site Studies) to with other common geocoding software. Furthermore, each method will be evaluated based on it ability to correctly estimate environmental exposures and community-level characteristics.

title: Neurobehavioral and Neuroimaging Effects of Traffic Exposure in Children
description: The association between exposure to traffic-related air pollutants (TRAP) during early childhood and neurobehavioral and neuroimaging outcomes has not been thoroughly examined. The objective of the proposed study is to determine if children exposed to increased levels of TRAP during critical time periods of brain development have altered neurobehavior in childhood as measured by a battery of valid and reliable tests and to assess the physiologic impact of TRAP exposure on brain structure, organization, and function using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These results will fill important gaps in current scientific knowledge related to the relationship between TRAP exposure and neurobehavior and central nervous system effects.

description: We have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare.

description: We are building a powerful toolkit to identify a relatively new class of therapeutic targets for cancer therapy. In cancer, the abnormal splicing of gene products can initiate cancer and lead to worse outcomes. With the completion of these aims, cancer researchers will be able to evaluate and understand the causes of aberrant gene splicing to target new pathways in diverse cancers.
